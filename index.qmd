# Background {.unnumbered}

For this workshop, we will be reproducing data from a study by @weighall2017 on the role of sleep in learning novel words (lexical consolidation).

Unlike in the Weighall et al. article, to simplify presentation, this book will focus on the comparison between adult and child participants in the processing of existing "lexical competitors", as in the words "candy" and "candle".

## Raw data

You will need to download and extract [data-raw.zip](https://osf.io/download/zrcn7/) into your working directory.

@sec-datastruct has a figure showing the structure of the data. You will probably need to refer back to this figure many times as you work through the exercises.
