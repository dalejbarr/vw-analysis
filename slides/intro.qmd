## Why be reproducible?

- many, many analytical choices to make
- easier to spot and correct errors
- analysis can be audited/verified by others
- it's more efficient (in the long run...)

## Weighall et al. (2017)

![](img/weighall_et-al_2017.jpg)

## Existing competitors

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

![*"click on the candy"*](../img/weighall-existing-competitor.jpg)

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| message: false
library("tibble")

tribble(~image, ~role,
        "candy", "target",
        "candle", "critical (competitor)",
        "lorry", "critical (unrelated)",
        "(thing)", "novel",
        "stamp", "existing") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Novel competitors

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

![*"click on the biscuit"*](../img/weighall-novel-competitor.jpg)

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| message: false
library("tibble")

tribble(~image, ~role,
        "biscuit", "target",
        "biscal", "critical (competitor)",
        "lorry", "critical (unrelated)",
        "(thing)", "novel",
        "stamp", "existing") %>%

## Your tools

## The "Wickham Six" one-table verbs

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble(~ name, ~description,
        "select", "include/exclude existing variables (columns)",
        "filter", "include/exclude observations (rows)",
        "mutate", "create a new variable",
        "arrange", "re-order the observations (rows)",
        "group_by", "change the unit of analysis",
        "summarize", "calculate summary values") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Piping things together

This...

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true
library("tidyverse")

## humans of star wars
hosw1 <- filter(starwars, species == "Human")
hosw2 <- select(hosw1, name, height, homeworld)

hosw2
```

---

...can be done more easily like this.

```{r}
#| echo: true
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(name, height, homeworld)
```


## The Ubiquitous `inner_join()`

When you have values scattered across tables, use `inner_join()` to join them together!

**Demo: which image was clicked on each trial?**


## Pre-processing tasks

1. Import
2. Epoching and time-alignment
3. Map point-of-gaze to areas of interest
4. Deal with trial dropouts

## 1. Import

![](../table-images/eye-data.png)

## 2. Epoching and time-alignment

![](../img/epoching.png)

## 3. Mapping POG to AOI

![](../img/screens.png)

## 4. Trial dropouts

![](img/trial-dropouts.jpg)

## Analysis

1. Plotting
2. Polynomial regression
3. Cluster-permutation analysis
